    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file and adding your MongoDB URI and JWT secret:
    ```dotenv
    MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

4. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    nodemon index.js
    ```
